<h1>ðŸŽ¬ The Best Movies According to Nicky ðŸŽ¬</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>
<hr>
<h3>Jurassic Park</h3>
<p>I love dinosaurs, I wish I could have one as my pet.</p>
<h3>Coraline</h3>
<p>I love this movie because it's spooky, but also funny, has a beautiful soundtrack and just one of the best stop-motions out there.</p>
<h3>Anything Star Wars</h3>
<p>Late to the game, but I'm hooked. The best one I've watched so far is Episode 5: The Empire Strikes Back.</p>
