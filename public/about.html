<h1>ðŸ‘½ About Me ðŸ‘½</h1>
<p>Hi, my name is Nicky and I'm passionate about learning!</p>

<h3>A bit about my background:</h3>

<p>I graduated from University College London with a Bachelors in Neuroscience in 2021. Shortly after, I started a job as a 
laboratory analyst running private testing for COVID-19, and later STI and blood testing. I did that for 1 year.</p>

<p>At the start of 2023, I started training as a data analyst at Rockborne, where I undertook several projects, including:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Creating a full relational database for a football club in PostgreSQL</li>
  <li>Using Excel to clean and perform analysis of historical data of road accidents</li>
  <li>Using Python to clean and perform analysis of historical UK crime data</li>
  <li>Creating a presentation with interactive charts in Power BI on Nintendo's success and sales history</li>
  <li>Python for many other applications e.g. Selenium to create an automatic 'typing tester', machine learning to predict patient cases at high risk of brain stroke, and web scraping to create a holiday browsing tool</li>
</ul>

<p>Now I am self-learning web development to expand my skillset. Currently, I am learning HTML and this website is my practice project. </p>
